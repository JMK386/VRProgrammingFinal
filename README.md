# VRProgrammingFinal
My final project for Virtual Reality Programming and Technology for the fall 2025 semester.

This game let's you explore a small city in VR and see the sights. To start it make sure to select the main scene and then build. Open the folder that you built into and click the .exe to open the game. Then you can explore to your heart's content!
